Finite state cascades represent an attractive architecture for parsing
unrestricted text.  Deterministic parsers specified by finite state
cascades are fast and reliable.  They can be extended at modest cost
to construct parse trees with finite feature structures.  Finally ,
such deterministic parsers do not necessarily involve trading off
accuracy against speed --- they may in fact be more accurate than
exhaustive search stochastic context free parsers.  Of current
interest in corpus oriented computational linguistics are techniques
for bootstrapping broad coverage parsers from text corpora.  The work
described here is a step along the way toward a bootstrapping scheme
that involves inducing a tagger from word distributions, a lowlevel
"chunk" parser from a tagged corpus, and lexical dependencies from a
chunked corpus.  In particular, I describe a chunk parsing technique
based on what I will call a finite state cascade.  Though I shall not
address the question of inducing such a parser from a corpus, the
parsing technique has been implemented and is being used in a project
for inducing lexical dependencies from corpora in English and German.
The resulting parsers are robust and very fast.

A finite state cascade consists of a sequence of levels.  Phrases at
one level are built on phrases at the previous level, and there is no
recursion: phrases never contain same level or higher level phrases.
Two levels of special importance are the level of chunks and the level
of simplex clauses.  Chunks are the non-recursive cores of `` major ''
phrases, i.e., NP, VP, PP, AP, AdvP.  Simplex clauses are clauses in
which embedded clauses have been turned into siblings --- tail
recursion has been replaced with iteration, so to speak.  To
illustrate, Table 1 shows a parse tree represented as a sequence of
levels.
