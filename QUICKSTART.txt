OBTAINING THE CODE

If you only need read access to the source (you are working on an application 
which uses minorthird but don't need to personally change minorthird) you can use 
anonymous access (anything as a password):

cvsroot= :pserver:anonymous@raff.cald.cs.cmu.edu/usr1/cvsroot
with module "minorthird"

If you want write access to the source (you plan to change or add to our software) 
you need an account on the Raff computer.  You can then use the following cvsroot to 
access minorthird:

cvsroot= :ext:<your user name>@raff.cald.cs.cmu.edu/usr1/cvsroot
with module "minorthird"


To do this you'll need CVS, which is generally installed on
unix systems.  For windows I recommend using the cygwin package,
easily installed from http://cygwin.com, which provides most of
the basic unix functionality.  http://www.cvshome.org has all
the documentation you'll ever want on CVS, and then some.

For a Windows explorer integrated CVS client, TortoiseCVS is recommended from
http://www.tortoisecvs.org

OTHER STUFF YOU'LL NEED

To compile the code and run it, you'll need to have java (v 1.4 or
later) installed, plus a 'make'-like system called 'ant'.  Java is
available from http://java.sun.com.  The latest issue was last seen at
'http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html' and generally is found
by looking for the 'Java 2 Standard Edition' SDK (software
developement kit). Ant is an Apache project which can be found at
http://ant.apache.org.  To install it, you'll want to

 1. define JAVA_HOME to be the root directory for java, eg
 'set JAVA_HOME=c:/j2sdk1.4.2' or wherever you put it.

 2. set the environment variable ANT_HOME to where ever you put it.

 3. add $ANT_HOME/bin to your path (plus $JAVA_HOME/bin)

COMPILING THE CODE

We recommend that you set an environment variable "MINORTHIRD" to where ever
you placed the project.

1. cd to MINORTHIRD
2. on unix with bash run
   % . script/setup.sh
   or on windows run
   % script\setup
3. to compile the code type the command
   % ant build-clean

4. to build the javadocs (in MINORTHIRD/javadoc) type the command
   % ant javadoc

SAMPLE COMMANDS

The directory minorthird/demos contains a number of examples and data.

There are some java classes with command-line interfaces, currently in
a bit of a mess wrt consistency.  For a demo of viewing a dataset, use
the command

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.gui.TextBaseViewer env/seminar-subset

For a demo of labeling a dataset, use the command

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.gui.TextBaseEditor env/seminar-subset mylabels.labels

This will create a file 'mylabels.labels' which saves your edits of the 
initially labeled documents associated with the tag 'seminar-subset.env'.

For a demo of using the 'mixup' language to label a document, create a mixup
file in 'myprogram.mixup' and run the command

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.gui.MixupDebugger -textBase env/seminar-subset -truth mylabels.env -mixup myprogam.mixup

Another sample command mixup program finds cell names:

% cp lib/labels/captions/cell.env myCellEdits.env  
% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.gui.MixupDebugger -textBase env/captions -truth myCellEdits.env -mixup lib/labels/captions/cell.mixup -stem

-------------------------------------------
NB: This section will change very soon as a better set of demos and samples are compiled.  Look for changes in the immediate future.

HOW SAMPLE FILES ARE STORED

What is test.bsh anyway?  I wanted a scheme in which
 - data files could be stored outside of cvs
 - labelings of data files and mixup programs could be stored inside of cvs 
 - one could specify a datafile with a single short key

The scheme I came up with is the following. The file
minorthird/config/data.properties defines three directory locations:
dataDir, for large datasets; labelDir, for data files that are used to
construct labelings; and scriptDir, for beanShell scripts that load in
a datafile.  The edu.cmu.minorthird.text.FancyLoader object takes the name of
a file in the scriptDir, runs it, are returns the result.
