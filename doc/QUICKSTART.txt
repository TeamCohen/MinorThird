==============================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE YOU INSTALL
==============================================================================

To compile the code and run it, you'll need to have java (v jdk1.4 or
later) installed, plus a 'make'-like system called 'ant'.  Java is
available from http://java.sun.com and generally is found
by looking for the 'Java 2 Standard Edition' SDK (software
developement kit). Ant is an Apache project which can be found at
http://ant.apache.org.  To install it, you'll want to

 1. define JAVA_HOME to be the root directory for java, eg
 'set JAVA_HOME=c:/j2sdk1.4.2' or wherever you put it.

 2. set the environment variable ANT_HOME to where ever you put it.

 3. add $ANT_HOME/bin to your path (plus $JAVA_HOME/bin)

To download the code, you'll need CVS, which is generally installed on
unix systems.  For windows I recommend using the cygwin package,
easily installed from http://cygwin.com, which provides most of the
basic unix functionality.  http://www.cvshome.org has all the
documentation you'll ever want on CVS, and then some.

For a Windows explorer integrated CVS client, TortoiseCVS is
recommended, from http://www.tortoisecvs.org

OBTAINING THE MINORTHIRD CODE
==============================================================================

If you only need read access to the source (you are working on an
application which uses minorthird but don't need to personally change
minorthird) you can use anonymous CVS access.

Set these environment variables:

    CVS_RSH=ssh
    cvsroot=:pserver:anonymous@raff.ml.cmu.edu:/usr1/cvsroot

Then use these commands:

     % cvs login
     (anything as a password)
     % cvs checkout minorthird
     % cvs update -dP

The 'update -dP' command is needed to remove deleted-from-cvs files
and directories.

If you want write access to the source (you plan to change or add to
our software) you need an account on the Raff computer.  You can then
use the following to access minorthird:

    % cvs -d :ext:you@raff.ml.cmu.edu:/usr1/cvsroot checkout minorthird

==============================================================================
COMPILING THE CODE
==============================================================================

We recommend that you set the environment variable "MINORTHIRD" to
whereever you placed the project.

1. set MINORTHIRD variable
2. cd to MINORTHIRD
3. on unix with bash source the setup
   % source script/setup.sh
   or on windows run
   % script\setup
4. to compile the code type the command
   % ant build-clean
5. to build the javadocs (in MINORTHIRD/javadoc) type the command
   % ant javadoc
6. you can run the tests to be sure things are working
   % ant tests

==============================================================================
USING MINORTHIRD
==============================================================================

Minorthird is partly an SDK - it toolkit for developing programs.  To
use it in this way, you should look over the javadocs.

Some of the most important functionality in minorthird is in a handful
of of programs with command-line interfaces which are located in the
package edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.  The command

 % java -Xmx500M edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.Help

will quickly list these programs.  To get help on a particular program,
for instance TrainTestExtractor program, type 

 % java -Xmx500M edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TrainTestExtractor -help

The ui-package programs can generally be invoked either using
command-line options, or using a simple GUI interface. To use the GUI
interface, use 

 % java -Xmx500M edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.TrainTestExtractor -gui

For more information on how to use the Extractractor and Classifier, refer
to the HowToClassification and HowToExtraction documents in this
directory.

You can put some or all of the command-line options in a file, using
the syntax of Java property files, and set the options all at once
using the option "-config FILENAME".

Some other useful command-line programs are not in the ui package.  To
summarize text data, use the command

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.SummarizeLabels dataFile

For using the 'mixup' language to label a document, create a mixup
file in 'myprogram.mixup' and run the command

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.gui.MixupDebugger -textBase data -truth mylabels.labels -mixup myprogam.mixup

For experiments with the classification toolkit (not using text) look
at edu.cmu.minorthird.classify.UI, which has a look-and-feel similar
to the programs in edu.cmu.minorthird.ui.

For a demo of labeling a dataset, cd to minorthird/demos, compile
LabelerDemo.java (with "javac LabelerDemo.java") and type

% java LabelerDemo

You can also try out

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.text.gui.TextBaseEditor DATAFILE LABELFILE

Many objects in minorthird can be visualized with a set of Swing
classes called "Viewers".  When you're in a viewer you can sometimes
save the object you're viewing.  To view the an object you saved in
the file "foo" use

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.util.gui.ViewerFrame foo

One object that can be saved this way is an "Evaluation", which is a
summary of the results of a classification experiment.  You can view
and compare multiple Evaluations from files foo1.eval, foo2.eval,...
with

% java edu.cmu.minorthird.classify.experiments.EvaluationGroup foo*.eval

DOCUMENTATION

There are some 'HowTo' documents in minorthird/doc.

Some sample data can be found in minorthird/demos/sampleData, and some
sample mixup programs are in minorthird/demos/sampleMixup.  "Standard"
mixup can be viewed in /lib/mixup.

Some of these are out of date - however, there is also some sample
software in minorthird/demos/:

LabelerDemo.java:
	Loads a set of data and a set of labels, optionally runs a mixup program on the data for more labels.
	The data and labels are displayed by TextBaseEditor; the labels can be edited.  With no arguments
	this runs on some hard-wired sample inputs (if you run in the minorthird/demos directory).
	
mixupDemo.bat:
	Runs three progressively more powerful mixup files on a sample data file
	After each run it launches the MixupDebugger, which displays the labelling on the data
	[William, 3/21/04 - this doesn't seem to work]
	
NumericDemo.java:
	Loads a training and test datasets; trains and tests a NaiveBayes classifier on the given data.
	The Evaluation.toGUI is used to produce a graphical display of the results.

There are some java classes with command-line interfaces, with are somewhat inconsistent currently.  

LOADING DATA INTO MINORTHIRD

Minorthird usually starts with a collection of documents (a
"TextBase") that has been annotated (with "TextLabels").  There are
several ways to load data into minorthird.  

The simplest is to prepare a directory containing one file per
document, with XML tags embedded in the documents to indicate the
labels.  An example of this is
minorthird/demo/sampleData/seminar-subset.  To load this into one of
the ui programs, use the options -labels DIR where DIR is the
directory name.

The most flexible is to use the minorthird repository mechanism.  The
easiest way to get started is to copy over an existing repository,
like the one on /afs/cs/project/extract-learn/repository.  The
configure minorthird by changing the parameter
"edu.cmu.minorthird.repository" in the file
minorthird/config/data.properties to point to the directory you saved
the repository in.

The repository has three subdirectories. A data directory, for large
datasets; a label directory, for data files that are used to construct
labelings; and a loader directory, for beanShell scripts that
construct TextLabels objects from these resources.  The name of a
script in the loader directory is called a "repository key", and
defines some (perhaps arbitrary) slice of labeled data.  Any of these
subdirectories can be reconfigured if you need.

A handful of toy sample datasets are provided in demos/sampleData.  A
handful of very small debugging datasets are built-in to the code, so
they will show up no matter how badly your repository configuration is
dorked up. These have names like sample1.train.  Sample1 is a toy
extraction problem; sample2 is a version of the same task, but labeled
for tagger-learning; sample3 is a toy classification problem.
