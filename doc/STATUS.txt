CONFIDENCE FOR EXTRACTORS

classify.sequential:
 SequenceClassifier {
  // replace null values in prediction with the best classifications 
  // that are consistent with the non-null values
  void consistentlyClassify(ClassLabel[] prediction,Instance[] seq);
 }
 CMM {
  // needs to implement this
 }

// this wraps a text.learn.SequenceAnnotatorLearner.SequenceAnnotator
// and adds confidences
text.learn.ConfidenceReportingSequenceAnnotator implements ExtractorAnnotator,Serializable,Visible extends AbstractAnno
{
 doAnnotate {
   Span.Looper i = labels.getTextBase().documentSpanIterator();
   while (i.hasNext() ) {
       Span s = i.nextSpan();
       String documentId = ...
       MonotonicSubTextLabels tmpLabels = ... // contains just this document
       Instance[] sequence = new Instance[s.size()];
       for (int j=0; j<s.size(); j++) {
           Span tokenSpan = s.subSpan(j,1);
           sequence[j] = fe.extractInstance(labels,tokenSpan);
       }
       ClassLabel[] classLabels = seqClassifier.classification( sequence );
       double confidence = ...
       for (int j=0; j<classLabels.length; j++) {
           labels.setProperty( s.getToken(j), reduction.getTokenProp(), classLabels[j].bestClassName() );
	   reduction.extractFromTags( annotationType, tmpLabels );
	   for each annotationType label in tmpLabels {
	       use consistentlyClassify to find best classification consistent with NOT including this extraction
	       add the correct classification to labels
	   }
       }
   }
 }
}
 

RANKING ISSUES

 Simple approach: like multi
  - classify.rank includes RankingLearner, which extends BatchBinaryClassifierLearner
  batchTrain does a split into subpops and then does batchTrain(subpops) - which might be
  a sequenceDataset?
  - RankingEvaluation is a new class (should we include abstract type of evaluation? or just
  build the intelligence to build the correct type into Tester? 
  - GraphSearchEval will extend (or wrap) a RankingEvaluation

 There are now a bunch of parallel train/test/eval routines:

 classify (Dataset, ClassifierTeacher, ClassifierLearner, Classifier, Evaluation)
 classify.sequential (SequenceDataset, SequenceClassifierTeacher, BatchSequenceClassifierLearner, 
		      SequenceClassifier, and same Evaluation)
 classify.multi (same everything)
 classify.rank would be yet another...
 learn.text. ....
 
 Each includes: Teacher, Learner, Performer, TrainingData, Splitter, Evaluation
 can we have generic algorithms for training, CV-based testing, etc?
 

PROPOSED EXTENSION TO HANDLE RETOKENIZED TEXTBASES:

 in text: 
   - labeled pointer from parent textBase to spanType/retokenized textbases

 in SpanFE: 
   - from(s,textLabels).toLevel("foo") returns corresponding span s'/textLabels' on level "foo"

 MIXUP_COMMAND -> onLevel name;   // push level
 MIXUP_COMMAND -> offLevel;       // back to parent level
 // alternative might be "onLevel foo { .... } which produces a mixup program
 // that will run on the child level named "foo"
 MIXUP_COMMAND -> defLevel name: LEVELDEF+ ;  // produce new child textbase
 LEVELDEF -> from DOCSPANTYPE 
          | token ( re RE | class CLASS | filter MIXUP_TOKENEXPR )
          | pseudoToken ATOM=SPANTYPE(, ATOM=SPANTYPE)+
 GENERATOR -> importFromLevel name SPANTYPE=SPANTYPE (,SPANTYPE=SPANTYPE)+

PRIORITIES:
 - SVMs: update svmlib to get confidences?
 - fix bug in SVM save/restore
 - stderr on error rates/f1's -done, sortof

BUGS:
  - does showTestDetails change the result?
  - should precision/recall start at something other than 1.0 (max precision?)
  - graph doesn't come out if there is no range?
  - spanClosures are not stored properly (only by document); should really store tokenProps also,
  and CWA isn't even tracked for span properties
  - span diff fails for nested spans, eg "a b c <x>d e<x>f g</x> h i j</x>k"

UI tweaks:
  - in TextBaseViewer, an 'apply' button?
  - stop task?
  - can we save all edited changes to an experiment as a config file?
  - should sequenceLearner mark up the environment shown to the user?
  - progress counter & threads for dataset loading?   

LARGER PROJECTS:

 - bootstrapping 
 - pruning & shrinkage for maxent & CRFs
 - heirarchical learning

MEDIUM TASKS:

 - POS tagger

CLEANUPS/DESIGN:

 - clean up AnnotationExample - should some of code go in Extraction2TaggingReduction?
 - should I have default FE's in SequenceAnnotatorLearner,
 SegmentAnnotatorLearner, ClassifierAnnotatorLearner?  that are called
 by UI.Recommended
 - clean up util.Loader?
 - linkage issues: do classify, util compile separately?
 - remove apps/ksteppe, broken demos, BatchInsideOutsideLearner,BatchFilteredFinderLearner,BinaryExample,
    InfoGainInstanceTransform
 - transform.MaskedInstance could be more efficient
 - classify.algorithm.random, classify.algorithm.active are misplaced
 - explanations are messy in text - structure them?
 - edo code: Spiltter, punk => grep, get rid of stopwords in file?
 - Conventions to get names consistently used.

 To evaluate:
 - should Hyperplane extend MutableInstance ?
 - separate out feature extractor loading from classifier loading somehow?

  - splitters are type-safe
  - boosting/decision trees 
  -- ant tests to confirm independence of cls, txt-ann, bb
  -- cls.Instance includes a 'getSubpopulationId' which is an string naming the "subpopulation"
    (strata); use Pradeep's CrossValHandler to handle cross-validation of subpopulation's.
  -- cls.expt.RandomSplitter and new CrossValSplitter respect subpopulation's
  -- cls.expt.SimpleRandomSplitter doesn't respect subpopulation's
  -- re-organized learning code in cls:
   --- Classifier is almost a marker interface, with BinaryClassifier and KWayClassifier being the
       'real' interfaces of interest.  There are similar splits for Example and ClassifierLearner.
   ---- Hyperplanes, VotedPerceptron, NaiveBayes are now in cls.linear
  -- allow optional spanTypes, eg @foo? for optional occurance of foo
  -- implement "defSpanType foo =bar- EXPR
  - Classifier{Learner} is abstract, with KWay and Binary as subclasses
  - generic text progress counter
  - start-end-length annotator
  - allow regex's as an alternative deftype, eg defSpanType foo =bar~ re 'in ([a-z]+)',1
   - simple learning expt for txt.ann & cls
   -- cls.expt includes a generic Splitter object which splits any iterator into folds, train/test splits, 
   etc;
