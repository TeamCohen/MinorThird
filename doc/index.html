		<font size=+1>MinorThird</font> is a collection of Java classes for storing
		text, annotating text, and learning to extract
		entities and categorize text.  It was written
		primarily by <a href="http://wcohen.com">William
		W. Cohen</a>, a professor at <a
		href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon
		University</a> in the <a
		href="http://www.cald.cs.cmu.edu">Center for Automated
		Learning and Discovery</a>. Contributions have been
		made by many other colleagues and students including
		<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eairoldi">Edoardo
		Airoldi</a>, <a

		Carvalho</a>, Einat Minkov, <a
		href="http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/">Sunita

		development of Minorthird was primarily funded by the
		<a href="http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/">Information
		Processing Technology Office (IPTO)</a> of the <a
		href="http://www.darpa.mil/">Defense Advanced Research

<h3>What's Different About MinorThird</h3>

<p>
Minorthird's toolkit of learning methods is integrated tightly
with the tools for manually and programmatically annotating text.
Additionally, Minorthird differs from existing NLP and learning
toolkits in a number of ways:

<ul>
<li> Unlike many NLP packages (eg GATE, Alembic) it combines tools for
 annotating and visualizing text with state-of-the art learning
 methods.

<li> Unlike many other learning packages, it contains methods to
 visualize both training data and the performance of classifiers,
 which facilitates debugging.  Unlike other learning packages less
 tightly integrated with text manipulation tools, it is possible to
 track and visualize the transformation of text data into machine
 learning data.

<li> Unlike many packages (including WEKA), it is open-source, and
 available for both commercial and research purposes.

<li> Unlike any open-source learning systems I know of, it is
 architected to support active learning and on-line learning, which
 should facilitate integration of learning methods into agents.
</ul>

<p>
In Minorthird, a collection of documents are stored in a database
called a "TextBase".  Logical assertions about documents in a TextBase
can be made, and stored in a special "TextLabels" object. "TextLabels"
are a type of "stand off annotation"---unlike XML markup (for
instance), the annotations are completely independent of the text.
This means that the text can be stored in its original form, and that
many different types of (perhaps incompatible) annotations can be
associated with the same TextBase.

<p>
Each TextLabels annotation asserts a category or property for a word,
a document, or a subsequence of words. (In Minorthird, a sequence of
adjacent words is called a "span".)  As an example, these annotations
might be produced by human labelers; they might be produced by a
hand-writted program, or annotations by a learned program.  TextLabels
might encode syntactic properties (like shallow parses or part of
speech tags) or semantic properties (like the functional role that
entities play in a sentence).  TextLabels can be nested, much like
variable-binding environments can be nested in a programming language,
which enables sets of hypothetical or temporary labels to be added in
a local scope and then discarded.

<p>
Annotated TextBases are accessed in a single uniform way. However,
they are stored in one of several schemes. A Minorthird "repository"
can be configured to hold a bunch of TextLabels and their associated
TextBases.
          
<p>
Moderately complex hand-coded annotation programs can be implemented
with a special-purpose annotation language called Mixup, which is part
of Minorthird.  Mixup is based on a the widely used notion of cascaded
finite state transducers, but includes some powerful features,
including a GUI debugging environment, escape to Java, and a kind of
subroutine call mechanism.  Mixup can also be used to generate
features for learning algorithms, and all the text-based learning
tools in Minorthird are closely integrated with Mixup. For instance,
feature extractors used in a learned named-entity recognition package
might call a Mixup program to perform initial preprocessing of text.

<p>
Minorthird contains a number of methods for learning to extract and
label spans from a document, or learning to classify spans (based on
their content or context within a document).  A special case of
classifying spans is classifying entire documents.  Minorthird
includes a number of state-of-the-art sequential learning methods
(like conditional random fields, and discriminative training methods
for training hidden Markov models).

<p>
One practical difficulty in using learning techniques to solve NLP
problems is that the input to learners is the result of a complex
chain of transformations, which begin with text and end with very
low-level representations.  Verifying the correctness of this chain of
derivations can be difficult.  To address this problem, Minorthird
also includes a number of tools for visualizing transformed data
and relating it to the text from which it was derived.
