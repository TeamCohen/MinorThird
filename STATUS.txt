[need to back out changes in CompactInstance.toString(), test changes to database]

ACRONYMS:

Klinger: Knowledgeable Learning for Information Gathering and Extraction in RADAR

MinorThird: Modules for Identifying Names and Ontological Relationships in
	    Text using Heuristics for Inducing Regularities in Data

BUGS:
   - span diff fails for nested spans, eg "a b c <x>d e<x>f g</x> h i j</x>k"
   - 'back' in ViewerFrame, 'save' after zoom in ViewerFrame 
   - classify.util is dead code (but sticky)
   - performance issues loading in large files (with markup?)

PRIORITIES:

SMALL TO DO:
   - SVM extraction test
   - classify tests from testpackage
   - dictionary loading is inefficient - need MixupInterpreter to store dictionaries and tries.
   - it's hard to load files properly from a jar; should let MixupProgram take streams, and let library-loading
      routines work off the classpath using { InputStream s = ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream("foo.txt");
     LineNumberReader r = new LineNumberReader(new InputStreamReader(s)) }
   - get rid of (labels, base) pairs
   - maxent - stanford or openNLP? 
   - fix smoothing in logistic regression
   - better system.out i/o for ProgressCounter
   - experimental support for external learners
   - efficiency issues with loading large datasets
   - cleanup loaders: loadTaggedFiles vs loadFiles
   - colors in "details" view of ClassifiedDataset
   - filter by class in dataset view of ClassifiedDataset
   - learning curve experiments
   - make SpanLooperViewer use ViewerControls
   - NaiveBayes - make multi-class?
   - check that example weights are handled properly throughout .cls
   - check that explain is implemented throughout .cls
   - one vs all learner, round robin learner
   - leave one out splitter
   - should there be Span.Set, Feature.Set?
   - decision rules - based on decision tree code?
   - winnow, mira, aggressive perceptrons

BIG TO DO/EXTENSIONS:

 - more wizards
 - evaluate performance on some more sample problems
 - CSMM, CRF?
 - how to attach a confidence to spans labeled with CMM's?

CLEANUPS/DESIGN:

 - edo code: Spiltter, punk => grep, get rid of stopwords,
 - CompactInstance - where to use it? maybe in loaders and feature extractors
 - Look for dead code (ExptGUI, etc)
 - Conventions to get names consistent.
 - Done: Eliminate data directory, move to examples/data?
 - cls class should be smaller, with 'meta' (containing boost, stack,
 active, batch/online adaptors, etc) split off
 - SpanFE cleanup: no defaults, features for whole span. 
 - Text GUI rewrite

 To evaluate:
 - replace 'eq.foo' with 'has.foo and 'countOf.foo=K'?
 - should Hyperplane extend MutableInstance ?
 - separate out feature extractor loading from classifier loading somehow? 

SLIF PRIORITIES:

 - look at pasta protein data
 - candidate-label 100 captions for proteins -get from wizard?
 - finish imagePtr learning, cellFinding, captionUnderstanding

  -- ant tests to confirm independence of cls, txt-ann, bb
  -- cls.Instance includes a 'getSubpopulationId' which is an string naming the "subpopulation"
    (strata); use Pradeep's CrossValHandler to handle cross-validation of subpopulation's.
  -- cls.expt.RandomSplitter and new CrossValSplitter respect subpopulation's
  -- cls.expt.SimpleRandomSplitter doesn't respect subpopulation's
  -- re-organized learning code in cls:
   --- Classifier is almost a marker interface, with BinaryClassifier and KWayClassifier being the
       'real' interfaces of interest.  There are similar splits for Example and ClassifierLearner.
   ---- Hyperplanes, VotedPerceptron, NaiveBayes are now in cls.linear
  -- allow optional spanTypes, eg @foo? for optional occurance of foo
  -- implement "defSpanType foo =bar- EXPR
  - Classifier{Learner} is abstract, with KWay and Binary as subclasses
  - generic text progress counter
  - start-end-length annotator
  - allow regex's as an alternative deftype, eg defSpanType foo =bar~ re 'in ([a-z]+)',1
   - simple learning expt for txt.ann & cls
   -- cls.expt includes a generic Splitter object which splits any iterator into folds, train/test splits, 
   etc; 


==============================================================================

LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN:

 -- test cases for extraction learning
 -- active learning for classification
 -- active learning for extraction
 -- HMM's: conditionally & generatively trained

VOTED PERCEPTRON TRAINING:

 Hyperplane h = new Hyperplane();
 for each sequence i {
   Example[] seq = i.nextSequence();
   // find sequence labels l1, l2, ... such that <seq[j]+lj> has 
   // the top score according to h
   ClassLabel[] viterbi = BeamSearch.viterbi(h,seq);
   for (j=0, j<seq.length; j++) {
      if (viterbi[i]!=seq[i].label) {
         // extended instance contains label as a feature??????????
	 Instance seqInst1 = new ExtendedInstance(seq, "label."+seq[i].bestClassName);
	 Instance seqInst2 = new ExtendedInstance(seq, "label."+viterbi[i].bestClassName);
	 h.increment( seqInst1, +1 );
	 h.increment( seqInst2, -1 );
      }
   }
 }
    
 goal is hyperplane that contains features for <xi,yi>, and hence can
 distinguish "good" x/y pairs from "bad" ones.  Rather than have all
 features include yi, one could have |Y| hyperplanes with only
 xi-based features. 

 Classifier c contains |Y| hyperplanes, one per class;
 and to score label yi for xi, use h[yi](x)

 for each sequence i {
   Example[] seq = i.nextSequence();
   // find sequence labels l1, l2, ... such that <seq[j]+lj> has 
   // the top score according to h
   ClassLabel[] viterbi = BeamSearch.viterbi(c,seq);
   for (j=0, j<seq.length; j++) {
       if (seq[j] != viterbi[j], or seq[j-k] != viterbi[j-k] for some k such that y[i-k] is a feature for x[i]) {
       	  y+ = seq[j];
	  y- = viterbi[j];
	  xj+ = InstanceFromSequence( seq[j], seq );
	  xj- = InstanceFromSequence( seq[j], viterbi ); // will be similar, except for y labels
	  c.h[ y+ ] += xj+;	 // strengthen hyperplane supporting correct labels
	  c.h[ y- ] -= xj-;	 // weaken hyperplane supporting false labels
      }
   }
 }
