UI notes:

to do:
  finish gui
  - split out UIMain into its own class-done
  - finish making all the params stuff gui-accessible
  - finish visual layout, etc
  simple annotator API 
  figure out how to configure text classifier fe's
  -- bagOfProperties, bagOfTypes?

BUGS:
   - MontyLingua loaded every time a 'require POS' happens
   - should precision/recall start at something other than 1.0 (max precision?)
   and have a graph come out somehow if there is no range?
   - spanClosures are not stored properly (only by document); should really store tokenProps and spanProps also
   - new SmartVanillaViewer(object ) doesn't work as well as loading object after creation-fixed?
   - span diff fails for nested spans, eg "a b c <x>d e<x>f g</x> h i j</x>k"
   - performance issues loading in large files (with markup?)

CLEANUPS/DESIGN:

 - fix FeatureFactory mess
 - move Dependency to text, remove 'requirements' in Annotator
 - add to mixup 'begin' ... 'end exporting a as b,c as d,...;'
 - transform.MaskedInstance could be more efficient
 - classify.algorithm.random, classify.algorithm.active are misplaced
 - explanations are messy in text - structure them?
 - edo code: Spiltter, punk => grep, get rid of stopwords in file?
 - CompactInstance - where to use it? maybe in loaders and feature extractors?
   current scheme runs out of memory with multiple repeated learning experiments in
   same JVM?
 - Conventions to get names consistently used.
 - SpanFE cleanup: no defaults, features for whole span, no feature buffer 
 - Text GUI rewrite: labeler, viewer

 To evaluate:
 - replace 'eq.foo' with 'has.foo and 'countOf.foo=K'?
 - should Hyperplane extend MutableInstance ?
 - separate out feature extractor loading from classifier loading somehow?

  - refactored guis, see com.wcohen.util.gui  
  - more documentation & guidelines
  - example of classifier learning - webmaster commands?
  - LogisticRegressor should be a BatchBinaryClassifierLearner
  - add special UnivariateLogisticRegressor subclass with an instance that just holds "x"
  - BatchVersion(OnlineBinaryClassifierLearner learner) - creates dataset & trains
  - keep word counts in SpanFE
  - added calibrated binary classifier, online learner, logistic regression

    as isPositive, isNegative, isCorrect()
  - bug fix: mixup debugger - can't add spans until after an "import"
  - decision trees - numeric features
  - refactored the Examples/BinaryExamples/KWayExamples to move
  more functionality into the Example level
  - clean up annotator learner - should have access to labels, which is used in
   training (for FE) and assumed to exist at test time.
  - set up test cases for classifiers and TestPackage
  - splitters are type-safe
  - boosting/decision trees 
  -- ant tests to confirm independence of cls, txt-ann, bb
  -- cls.Instance includes a 'getSubpopulationId' which is an string naming the "subpopulation"
    (strata); use Pradeep's CrossValHandler to handle cross-validation of subpopulation's.
  -- cls.expt.RandomSplitter and new CrossValSplitter respect subpopulation's
  -- cls.expt.SimpleRandomSplitter doesn't respect subpopulation's
  -- re-organized learning code in cls:
   --- Classifier is almost a marker interface, with BinaryClassifier and KWayClassifier being the
       'real' interfaces of interest.  There are similar splits for Example and ClassifierLearner.
   ---- Hyperplanes, VotedPerceptron, NaiveBayes are now in cls.linear
  -- allow optional spanTypes, eg @foo? for optional occurance of foo
  -- implement "defSpanType foo =bar- EXPR
  - Classifier{Learner} is abstract, with KWay and Binary as subclasses
  - generic text progress counter
  - start-end-length annotator
  - allow regex's as an alternative deftype, eg defSpanType foo =bar~ re 'in ([a-z]+)',1
   - simple learning expt for txt.ann & cls
   -- cls.expt includes a generic Splitter object which splits any iterator into folds, train/test splits, 
   etc;
