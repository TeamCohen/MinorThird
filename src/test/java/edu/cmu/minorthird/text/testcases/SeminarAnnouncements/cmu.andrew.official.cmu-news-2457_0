<paragraph> ABSTRACT: <sentence>In my talk, I will describe how a cognitive model was used
 as a simulated student to help design instructions for training
 circuit board assemblers</sentence>.  <sentence>The model was built in the Soar cognitive
 architecture, and was initially endowed with only minimal prerequisite
 knowledge of the task, and an ability to learn instructions</sentence>.  <sentence>Lessons
 for teaching expert assembly skills were developed by iteratively
 drafting and testing instructions on the simulated student</sentence>.</paragraph>
