Least you think bad taste is something new:
Back in the early 1970s I saw a couple of cars with *flocked* paint jobs.
Thats not a typo. I think they sprayed on some kind of glue then blew
on tiny pieces of nylon. It comes out looking like felt. Can you picture
a huge Plymouth Fury III in dark blue felt? I think I can even remember
one guy who did it in red to a early 1960s Corvette. That was after he had
turned it into a station wagon.
