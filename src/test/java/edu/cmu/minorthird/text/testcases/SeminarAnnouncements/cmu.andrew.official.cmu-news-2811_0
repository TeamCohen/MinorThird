<paragraph><sentence>Phonological and semantic priming was explored in children using a
cross-modal picture-word interference paradigm</sentence>.  <sentence>Pictures of familiar
objects (e.g., snake, moon, hand) were presented to 5- to 11-year-olds
and adults on a computer screen while digitized auditory stimuli (words
and non-words) were presented simultaneously over head-phones</sentence>. <sentence>The
auditory stimuli were related (phonologically or semantically) or
unrelated to the names of the pictures</sentence>. <sentence>Children were instructed to name
the pictures as quickly as possible while ignoring the auditorily
presented items</sentence>. <sentence>Children were tested over multiple sessions to vary the
stimulus onset asyncrony (SOA--the interval between presentation of the
prime and presentation of the picture-to-be-named</sentence>). <sentence>Robust phonological
priming occurred which was influenced by the lexical status of the prime
(whether it was a non-word or a real word) and by whether the prime
shared the onset consonant or rhymed with the name of the target
picture</sentence>.  <sentence>In contrast, semantically-related auditory stimuli did not
facilitate children's picture naming</sentence>.</paragraph>
